1.  The "Int" code cleans and transforms the original data. It performs the following task:
    - Changes the date format
    - Replaces the name of each country with its sub-region's code
    - Eliminates the unecessary rows and columns
    - Adds new columns defining:
        ^ a win as a 1
        ^ a draw as a 0
        ^ a loss as a -1
        ^ goal_margin in favor of the winning team
    - Generates two new files:
        ^ changed_data which is in detailed form of the above
        ^ cleaned_data which is in the desired form, necessary for our analysis
       
       
2.  The "init_def" code generate a file which gives a complete observation of a specific combination of sub-regions, with only 4 variables:
        ^ year
        ^ region A
        ^ region B
        ^ goal_margin in favor of the winning team (home or away)
        ^ match_status in favor of the home team 
    The code generates the desired specific file with the name "region A_vs_region B.xlsx"
    
    
3.  The "anal001.R" is a R code that works with the desired specific files generated by the "init_def" code.
